## How to create your version of Frog Bot 2.0!

Remember that you need an established discord application for this to work. For a full tutorial, I also have a [tutorial page](https://github.com/HereJohnnyboi/Frog-Bot-2.0/blob/main/Tutorial.md) on this repository.

To create your own version of Frog Bot on Replit, click this button to create a copy of my code on Replit.

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/HereJohnnyboi/Frog-Bot-2.0)](https://repl.it/github/HereJohnnyboi/Frog-Bot-2.0)

When the repository is finished cloning, you will be prompted to configure the run button. If this is the case, type in `python main.py` and click "Done". The repl may reload and save. After that, click on shell. For the code to work, you must import packages. To import a package into the Repl, type `pip install packageName` into the shell, with `packageName` being the name of the package that needs to be installed. Import the following packages:

1. **Flask**
2. **PyNaCl**
3. **youtube_dl**
4. **discord.py**
5. **praw**
6. **bs4**
7. **discord-pretty-help**

When done importing packages, scroll all the way down and replace `bot.run(token)`
with `bot.run("number")`, with `"number"` being your application's token in quotes. When you are ready, click run and watch the magic happen.
